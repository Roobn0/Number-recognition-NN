# Number-recognition-NN
Neural network that recognizes digits 0-9  
Mnist dataset is inculded within Tensorflow python package, while the 500x500 resolution images are available on this url: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f2o1kjXLvcxRgtmMMuDkA2PQ5Zato4Or.  
Download and save the dataset to data folder and run the data.py file to process the images into a tensor that is usable by the model.
